# Metronome
A simple metronome app, with configurable BPM and time measure.
Made to get to know Gatsby / React a little.

## Notes
- ALl metronome logic is in a component
- Uses a worker for consistent intervals
- Uses a generated sound to avoid playback overlay

## TODO
- Testing
- Linting
- More tools
